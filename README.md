# Heart-Disease---Classifications-Machine-Learning-

INTRODUCTION
In this work the Dataset are collected from Kaggle.com .
We have a data which classified if patients have heart disease or not according to features in it. We will try to
use this data to create a model which tries predict if a patient has this disease or not.
Therefore Six machine learning classification algorithms namely Decision Tree, SVM and Naive Bayes,
Logistic Regression, KNN ,Random Forest are used in this experiment to detect heart disease. The
performances of all the algorithms are evaluated on measures Accuracy.

DATA EXPLORATION
Here,
The percentage of patient haven’t heart disease
The percentage of patient have heart disease
The percentage of patient Female
The percentage of patient Male

Percentage of Patients Haven't Heart Disease: 45.54%
Percentage of Patients Have Heart Disease: 54.46%! 1 st normalize the data by this formula:
ntage of Patients Haven't Heart Disease: 45.54%
Percentage of Patients Have Heart Disease: 54.46%

Than Apply logistic regression find the Accuracy 86.89%
Apply KNN find the Accuracy 88.52%
Apply SVM find the Accuracy 86.89%
Apply Naïve Bayes find the Accuracy 86.89%
Apply Decision Tree find the Accuracy 80.33%
Apply Random Forest find the Accuracy 88.52%

Accuracy is measured over correctly and incorrectly classified instances. Results obtained show KNN &
Random Forest outperforms with the highest accuracy of 88.52% comparatively other algorithms.
